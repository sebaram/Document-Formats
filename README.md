# ACM SIGCHI Document Formats #

This repository was a storage point for much older SIGCHI templates which
have long since been deprecated. 

If your conference is using The ACM Publishing System (TAPS), please
see [this article which outlines the workflow and
templates][taps]. This
includes best practices and accessibility requirements.

There is a chance where you may be using an _interm_ Word template. The
ACM has details on the [Master Article
Template][template] page.

As always, please refer to the _specific instructions from your
conference's call for papers_ and submissions.
